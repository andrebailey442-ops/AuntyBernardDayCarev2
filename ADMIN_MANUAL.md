## What Grown-Ups Can Do

You can do everything in the app, plus these special things:

*   **Add New People:** You can add new teachers and grown-ups to the app.
*   **Set the Rules:** You can choose what pages teachers are allowed to see.

You can find these tools in your menu at the top of the screen. Look for **Manage Users**.

## Adding and Removing People

This is where you can see everyone who uses the app.

### See Who Is Here

*   You will see a list of all the grown-ups and what their job is (`Admin` or `Teacher`).

### Add a New Person

1.  Click the **Add User** button.
2.  A little box will pop up.
    *   **Username:** Type in a name for them to use.
    *   **Password:** Give them a secret password.
    *   **Role:** Choose if they are an `Admin` or a `Teacher`.

## Setting Rules for Teachers

On the same page, you will see "Teacher Role Permissions." This is where you decide what teachers can see and do.

### How It Works

*   If you **check a box**, teachers will see a link for that page in their menu.
*   If you **uncheck a box**, the link will disappear. Teachers can't go to that page anymore.

### Changing the Rules

1.  Look at the list of pages.
2.  **Check the box** to give permission.
3.  **Uncheck the box** to take it away.
4.  Click **Save Changes** when you are finished.

The rules change for all teachers right away!
