## User & Permission Management

The **Manage Users** page (accessible from the user dropdown menu) is your central hub for controlling who can access the application and what they can do.

### User Management

This section lists all current users of the app.

*   **View Users**: See a list of all users, their email, and their assigned role (`Admin` or `Teacher`).
*   **Add New Staff/User**:
    1.  Click the **Add Staff** button.
    2.  Fill in the user's name, email, a temporary password, and assign a role.
    3.  Click **Add Staff**. The user is now active.
*   **Edit a User**:
    1.  Click the three-dots menu next to a user's name and select **Edit Profile**.
    2.  You can change their role or set a new password.
*   **Remove a User**:
    1.  Select **Remove User** from the dropdown menu.
    2.  Confirm the action. This is permanent and cannot be undone.

### Role Permissions Management

This section allows you to customize the user experience for teachers.

*   **How it Works**: The grid lists all major pages of the application. Checking a box grants all users with the 'Teacher' role access to that page. Unchecking it removes the link from their navigation menu.
*   **Default Admin Permissions**: Administrators have access to all pages. The "Manage Users" permission is locked for Admins.
*   **Saving Changes**:
    1.  Use the checkboxes to grant or revoke access for the 'Teacher' role.
    2.  Click **Save Teacher Permissions**. The changes take effect immediately for all teacher accounts.

## Staff Management

The **Staff** section is where you manage employee profiles, schedules, and attendance.

*   **Staff Profiles**: Add new staff members with their personal details and assigned roles (e.g., 'Preschool Attendant').
*   **Weekly Schedule**: Use the interactive table to set the work schedule for each staff member for the entire week. You can also download a printable PDF of the weekly roster.
*   **Daily Clock-in/Clock-out**: Monitor staff attendance in real-time. The system automatically flags late clock-ins.
*   **Edit Clock-in Time**: As an admin, you can manually adjust a staff member's clock-in time if they forgot to do it themselves.
*   **Log Archiving**: At the end of each day, archive the attendance log to keep records clean and ready for the next day.
